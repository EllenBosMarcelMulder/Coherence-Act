# **Liability Statement – Precautionary Principle and Protection of Future Generations**

## Declaration of Responsibility

From the moment of receipt of this document, all governments, corporations, insurers, and institutions addressed are formally notified of their **duty of care** under the **precautionary principle**.

The scientific evidence presented across the RC1 paradigm, the hexAI rhythmic manifest, and supporting dossiers demonstrates that **Digital Resonance Exposure (DRE)** and related rhythmic disruptions present credible risks to human health, social stability, and ecological balance.

Where there is credible risk — even without full scientific certainty — the law and ethics demand precautionary action. **Failure to act constitutes liability.**

## Legal and Ethical Basis

1. **Precautionary Principle** (Rio Declaration, Principle 15)
  
  > *“Where there are threats of serious or irreversible damage, lack of full scientific certainty shall not be used as a reason for postponing cost-effective measures to prevent environmental degradation.”*
  
2. **UN Convention on the Rights of the Child (Articles 3 and 24)**
  
  - The best interests of the child must be a primary consideration.
  - States shall recognize the right of the child to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of health.
3. **European Convention on Human Rights**
  
  - Article 2: Right to life
  - Article 8: Right to health, safety, and human dignity

## Intergenerational Responsibility

This liability extends beyond current populations. **Our descendants, the unborn, and future generations of humanity are entitled to protection from foreseeable harm.**

Neglect today will echo as damage in the lives of our children, and their children. This responsibility cannot be deferred, outsourced, or denied.

---

## Binding Statement

- **Neglect = Liability**
  Any failure to act on the knowledge presented constitutes **conscious complicity** in preventable harm.
  
- **Silence = Consent**
  Institutional silence will be documented and treated as acknowledgement of risk and abdication of duty.
  
- **Action = Shared Responsibility**
  Preventive measures, regulatory reform, and research investments undertaken immediately will mitigate liability and demonstrate compliance with the precautionary principle.

## Closing

This statement binds all addressed parties morally, politically, and legally. The responsibility is indivisible:
**To act today is to protect the lives of tomorrow.**
