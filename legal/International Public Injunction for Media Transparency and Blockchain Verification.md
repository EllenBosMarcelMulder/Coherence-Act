# International Public Injunction for Media Transparency and Blockchain Verification

## Framework establishing mandatory integral recording and transparent publication standards

### PREAMBLE

RECOGNIZING that truthful and complete information constitutes a fundamental human right essential to democratic society, scientific progress, and humanitarian protection;

ACKNOWLEDGING the convergence of international law principles under Article 19 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights¹, Article 10 of the European Convention on Human Rights², Article 13 of the American Convention on Human Rights³, and Article 9 of the African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights⁴;

INVOKING the philosophical foundations established by Jürgen Habermas on communicative rationality⁵, Hannah Arendt on the fragility of factual truth⁶, and the documented patterns of media manipulation identified by Noam Chomsky⁷ and Michel Foucault⁸;

IMPLEMENTING technological solutions through blockchain verification protocols⁹, cryptographic standards¹⁰, and distributed storage systems¹¹ to ensure tamper-proof documentation;

ESTABLISHING proportional enforcement mechanisms based on project value calculations, with penalties set at 0.01% of total project value per violation, escalating for systematic non-compliance;
