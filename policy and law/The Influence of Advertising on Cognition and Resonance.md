### **White Paper on Advertising Resonance, Cognitive Health, and the Precautionary Principle**

---

### **Executive Briefing**

This document describes the increasing and harmful influence of both digital and analog advertising on human cognition and public health. Traditional approaches fail due to "silo thinking," which does not recognize the interdependence of these influences. The core of this framework is the concept of **"resonance,"** where advertising expressions have a disruptive effect on the internal, neurophysiological state of the brain. This results in cognitive overload, decision-making fatigue, and a disrupted sleep rhythm, comparable to the health risks of addictive substances.

To quantify this multiple influence, we introduce the **Equivalent Resonance Dose (ERD)**. The ERD is a hypothetical, scientific metric that measures the total burden of advertising exposure on the brain, regardless of whether the stimuli come from a personalized online ad or a physical billboard. The model formalizes how factors such as the intensity, duration, and personal relevance of a stimulus translate into a cumulative "dose" that the brain receives. This creates a uniform scale that makes the harmful impact of different media types comparable.

The white paper proposes to validate this theory with a **`Deep-Dive Report: Scientific Facts and Established Concepts`**, which describes a detailed research agenda in the technical appendix (the `DRE-RAAM` model). This research must use measurable biomarkers (EEG, HRV) to demonstrate that advertising resonance negatively affects brain function.

The legal and policy implications are significant. The situation shows a strong parallel with the history of the **tobacco advertising ban**. At the time, irrefutable evidence of harm led to drastic regulation to protect public health, despite claims about commercial freedom. The document argues that the `precautionary principle` now applies, and that there is a strong basis for regulating manipulative advertising. This includes, among other things, limiting micro-targeting, introducing transparency, and auditing algorithms, with the ultimate goal of protecting cognitive autonomy and a healthy mental environment.

# **The Influence of Advertising on Cognition and Public Health: An Integrated Analysis and Framework**

### **Executive Summary**

Advertising — both digital and analog — is an omnipresent force in modern society. Research and data show that this exposure is not neutral; it can have significant effects on our cognitive processes, physiology, and decision-making. This document presents a consolidated overview of the scientific and conceptual foundations behind the impact of advertising.

We recognize that digital and analog advertising, despite their different forms, exploit the same neurological and psychological mechanisms. From dopamine-driven feedback loops in social media to unconscious stimuli in physical stores, advertising can exploit human vulnerability. Cumulative exposure to these stimuli can lead to cognitive overload, decision fatigue, and disrupted sleep.

To make this impact measurable and comparable, we introduce the concept of the **Equivalent Resonance Dose (ERD)**. This is a hypothetical, mathematical model that quantifies the total burden of advertising exposure on the brain by measuring the extent to which the stimuli "resonate" with an individual's internal state. This framework allows us to place the impact of digital and analog advertising on a single scale.

This report describes the existing scientific evidence, presents the formal ERD model, outlines a research agenda to test the hypotheses, and sketches the legal and policy implications. The goal is to lay a solid foundation for future research and policymaking, with the ultimate goal of protecting public health and cognitive autonomy.

### **Deep-Dive Report: Scientific Facts and Established Concepts**

Modern humans are inundated with advertising stimuli every day. Research estimates that we see between 4,000 and 10,000 advertisements every day. These advertising expressions come through both digital channels (such as social media, websites, and apps) and analog channels (for example, billboards on the street, packaging design in the supermarket, or the music played in stores). Despite the differences in form, digital and analog advertising often use the same underlying psychological and neurological mechanisms to grab our attention and influence our behavior. In this report, we analyze how both forms of advertising can activate resonance mechanisms in the brain – that is: stimuli that "vibrate along" with our cognitive and emotional processes – and what effects this has on our brain function, sleep, decision-making, and behavioral freedom. We introduce the idea of an Equivalent Resonance Dose (ERD) to quantify the impact of advertising exposure across all media. Finally, we compare the situation with the ban on tobacco advertising as a legal precedent, and discuss possible regulation of harmful advertising influences. The report is clearly structured, with examples, a table, and explanations for lay concepts (e.g., “What is an algorithm?”).

#### **Digital Advertising: Algorithms, Dopamine, and Microtargeting**

Digital advertising makes intensive use of algorithms to reach users. What is an algorithm? In simple terms, it is a step-by-step plan or a set of instructions that a computer follows to solve a problem or achieve a goal. Platforms like Facebook, Instagram, and YouTube use algorithms to show exactly the content and advertisements that match someone's interests and behavior. This phenomenon is called microtargeting: based on huge amounts of data, personalized advertising is offered that resonates maximally with the individual user. Think about the fact that you do an online search for sneakers and then see sneaker ads on every website for days – not by chance, but driven by the algorithm.

A consequence of this personal relevance is that digital advertising strongly appeals to the brain's dopamine reward system. Social media platforms are deliberately designed to keep users addicted through short feedback loops. For example, Facebook introduced the “like” button with the explicit goal of giving users a “small dopamine boost” and encouraging them to post more content. Every notification, like, or new post can provide a small shot of the happiness hormone (dopamine), which leads us to keep scrolling and coming back for more. Former Facebook president Sean Parker already warned that the platform's creators knew they were creating something addictive that plays on “a vulnerability in human psychology.” The result is a kind of behavioral seesaw: we get used to continuous stimuli and rewards, similar to gambling machines. Dr. Anna Lembke (addiction expert from Stanford) calls the smartphone "the modern hypodermic needle" for a reason, with which we are constantly looking for quick pleasure stimuli with every swipe and click. She states that we have all, to some extent, become dopamine addicts through digital media.

It is important that this constant flow of digital advertising stimuli can influence us unconsciously. Many online advertisements are interwoven into our content (sponsored posts that look like normal messages) so we often do not even realize we are seeing advertising. In addition, A/B tests and optimization are used: algorithms measure which version of an advertisement “resonates” the most (e.g., which one we click on most often or stay on for a long time) and show that version more often. In this way, our attention reflexes are maximally exploited. A flashy animation, a brightly colored “Buy now!” button, or a push notification at the right time – all of this directly triggers our brain. Digital advertising is therefore like a sniper: it focuses on our personal vulnerabilities and timing, to achieve maximum effect with minimal visibility.

#### **Analog Advertising: Billboards, Packaging, and Environmental Design**

In the physical world, too, advertising is omnipresent and refined in playing on our senses and emotions. Large billboards along the road attract our attention with bright colors, moving elements (on digital screens), and stimulating slogans. They actually act as visual lures: our eyes are drawn to them, often unconsciously. These attention grabbers can provide the same neurological excitement as online content – a brightly colored billboard or neon sign can evoke an “orienting response” in the brain, an automatic focus reaction to new stimuli.

In stores and supermarkets, analog influence works even more subtly. Store routing and shelf presentation are carefully thought out to stimulate certain behavior. For example, supermarkets often place essential products such as bread, milk, and eggs far apart or at the back of the store, so that customers are forced to walk through all the aisles and come across numerous impulse purchases along the way. The result is that people stay in the store longer (“linger for longer” strategy) and see more products that were not on the shopping list. MRI research even shows that after about 23 minutes of shopping, the brain shows decision fatigue: we become cognitively tired and switch from planned to impulsive buying. Stores respond to this by arranging the layout in such a way that we easily exceed those 23 minutes (e.g., by an illogical placement of products so that we have to search). After about 40 minutes we “are on autopilot” and more easily throw extra items in the cart without thinking.

Packaging design and use of color are also tailored to our psychology. Brightly colored sales signs in red or yellow attract attention immediately – we have learned that red/yellow often means “Action!”, so our eyes automatically go to it. Product packaging for sweets and snacks deliberately uses bright colors and attractive figures to evoke emotional resonance (for children, for example, cheerful cartoons that evoke feelings of pleasure). Neuromarketing research into packaging shows that subtle design choices – such as the placement of a logo, the “mouthwatering” photo of food on the box, or even the tactile feel of the material – can unconsciously guide our preference. Our brain processes these visual and tactile cues and links them to reward expectation: an attractive cookie package can literally make our mouth water, releasing dopamine in anticipation of the treat.

Furthermore, stores use music and scent to create a certain mood. Slow background music on the shop floor unconsciously makes customers walk slower and spend more time – and ultimately buy more. Classic experiment: in a wine store, playing French accordion music led customers to buy more French wine, while on days with German beer cellar music, German wine sold better. Most shoppers surveyed denied that the music influenced their choice, but the sales figures tell a different story. This illustrates subliminal influence in analog form: the tone (literally) resonates with cultural associations and guides behavior without us realizing it.

#### **Resonance Mechanisms: from Music to Subliminal Stimuli**

We see in both domains that resonance is central as a concept. Resonance literally means “vibrating along” – in physics, resonance occurs when an external vibration is equal to the natural frequency of a system, causing that system to vibrate extra strongly. A well-known example is a tuning fork that resonates when another tuning fork with the same pitch sounds next to it. In a figurative sense, applied to human behavior and emotions, resonance means that a certain message or stimulus strikes a chord with someone, as if it resonates with an inner string.

Advertising experts (both online and offline) try to achieve that resonance in all sorts of ways. Music is a good example of this: an advertising jingle or background music can “get stuck in the ear” – this is actually musical resonance in our memory. Earlier we mentioned how a suitable music theme in a store activates our cultural associations (French music ↦ desire for French wine). Here, resonance takes place between the memory associations (France = wine, coziness) and the external stimulus (the music). Outside the store context, music is also used in advertising to prime moods: cheerful tunes for soft drink commercials to create a happy feeling, calm ambient music in car advertisements to suggest reliability and comfort, etc. The frequencies and tempos of music can even slightly synchronize our heart rate and brain waves (for example, a calm slow tempo ↦ lower arousal). Such a physiological resonance is subtle, but it contributes to the mood that the ad wants to convey.

Subliminal messages are a more controversial but fascinating area of resonance. The famous “popcorn experiment” from 1957, by marketer James Vicary, claimed that moviegoers had unconsciously seen flashes of “Eat Popcorn” and “Drink Coca-Cola” for 1/3000th of a second, which increased popcorn sales by 57.5% and Coke sales by 18%. Although Vicary later admitted that this experiment was largely made up as a publicity stunt, the world was alarmed: the idea was born that unconscious resonance with our needs (hunger, thirst) could guide buying behavior without us realizing it. The commotion even led to subliminal “cuts” in movies and TV being banned in the US at the time. Later scientific research shows a more moderate picture: true subliminal influence is possible, but only under certain conditions. For example, Karremans et al. (2006) found that subjects who were thirsty were slightly more likely to choose the brand “Lipton Ice” after a subliminal flash of that word, compared to a control group – but only if they were already thirsty. This indicates that subliminal cues can have a resonance effect if the recipient is already in the right “frequency” (here: feeling thirsty). A dry mouth therefore “resonates” more easily with a hidden “Drink Lipton Ice” message than a saturated state would.

Sleep deprivation and exhaustion are, at first glance, very different topics, but they also play a role in how advertising resonates with us. When we are tired or sleep-deprived, our prefrontal cortex and other control functions work less well. We then become more impulsive, more emotional, and less sharp in our judgment. Research shows that even people who are normally very thoughtful are much more likely to take risks and make impulsive decisions after sleep deprivation. In other words: a tired brain “resonates” more easily with short-term stimuli and rewards, and is more easily guided by automatic impulses. Advertising can take advantage of this. Think of late-night television commercials or online shops that push flash sales late at night – exactly at the time when many people are tired on the couch and willpower is lower. Sleep deprivation, as it were, creates a state in which the “resonance threshold” for seductive stimuli is lower: the brain more easily vibrates along to the rhythm of the advertising (e.g., “Oh, why not buy it now, we'll see tomorrow”). In addition, excessive exposure to screens and notifications can itself contribute to worse sleep: blue light and constant stimulation suppress melatonin and disrupt the circadian rhythm, which in turn leads to a vicious circle of fatigue and increased susceptibility to influence.

#### **Structural Damage: Influence on Brain Function, Sleep, Decision-making, and Freedom**

When advertising messages resonate continuously and on so many fronts with our brain, the question arises: what is the cumulative impact on our health and autonomy? More and more researchers are warning that the bombardment of stimuli in which we live has structural effects.

*Brain function and cognition*: Our brains naturally need moments of rest. Constant advertising stimuli – especially via digital media – cause continuous attention switching and increase the stress level. This can lead to concentration problems and memory complaints. We live in a time of “information overload”: too much information to process. The brain then goes into a kind of defense mode, in which it processes things more superficially or starts to ignore them. Unfortunately, the advertising industry knows this and tries to become louder and more stimulating to still get through. This creates a vicious circle of hyper-stimulation. Research suggests that chronic overstimulation by digital media is associated with more mental fatigue and less creativity. We are getting better at quickly scanning information, but getting worse at deep focusing. This pattern is reminiscent of dopamine addiction: rewarding immediately (every new video, every ad is a mini-reward) at the expense of long-term thinking. As Lembke notes: we get used to constantly “interrupting” ourselves for a quick digital impulse, so we are rarely deeply concentrated on a task or thought for a long time. This can structurally change the brain, similar to how addiction rewires circuits.

*Sleep rhythm*: We already mentioned that screen use and notifications disrupt sleep in the evening. This is now well documented: exposure to the blue light of phones and tablets in the hour before bedtime suppresses melatonin production, the hormone that induces sleepiness. As a result, we find it more difficult to fall asleep and the quality of sleep is worse. Advertising plays an indirect role here: much of the addictive digital content that keeps us awake late at night is funded by ads (think of endlessly scrolling through TikTok or Instagram Reels). In addition, we are inclined to shop online or check social media late in the evening because of FOMO (fear of missing out) – fueled by notifications and offers that are deliberately timed for late hours. Chronic sleep deprivation, in turn, affects the brain: it reduces activity in the prefrontal cortex (important for judgment and impulse control) and increases the concentration of stress hormones. This makes us even more sensitive to tempters and stimuli (less inhibition, more impulse). In this way, continuous advertising pressure can cause a negative spiral of sleep and alertness.

*Decision-making and autonomy*: Perhaps the most worrying effect is that on our freedom of decision and free will. If advertising expressions – digital and analog – increasingly refine how they guide our choices, how many decisions do we really make autonomously? Tech insiders talk about a “hijacking of the mind”: our choices are not as free as we think, because in the background an army of persuasion mechanisms is at work. We believe that we buy that pair of sneakers or vote for that particular politician on our own initiative, but how often was this seed already planted days or weeks earlier by targeted advertisements? In extreme cases, such as the Cambridge Analytica affair, microtargeting was used to show voters very specific messages that played on their personal fears and beliefs, with the aim of influencing their voting behavior. This kind of manipulation of decision-making undermines the idea of the rational, autonomous citizen.

In addition, decision-making is influenced by choice architecture, of which advertising is a part. In the supermarket, we think we can choose from many brands, but due to shelf positions, packaging, and promotions, the choice has already been pre-cooked – we are more likely to grab a product that is at eye level or has a 2+1 promotion, even if that was not our plan. It is similar online: the first results on Google (often sponsored) get by far the most clicks, regardless of whether they are necessarily the best fit. Advertising and marketing therefore ensure that certain options systematically resonate more prominently in our attention than others, which at a population level guides our collective decision-making (think of consumption patterns, but also opinion formation).

*Behavioral freedom*: Ultimately, the question is to what extent we still have behavioral freedom as individuals. Freedom in behavior assumes that our actions arise from our own will, not from invisible coercion. While advertising is not hard coercion, it is stimulating on such a scale and so pervasive that some compare it to a public health risk. It is telling that the US Surgeon General in 2023 called for warning labels on social media, similar to those on cigarettes, because of the dangers to the mental health of young people. Social media, driven by advertising dollars, are therefore mentioned in the same breath as a form of addiction that limits our freedom. Forbes Magazine went even further with the headline “Scrolling is the new smoking,” referring to claims that frequent social media use is associated with increased loneliness, depression, worse sleep, and even higher suicide rates – similar damage to what smoking does to physical health. Although such comparisons are partly rhetorical, they indicate how serious the impact is estimated to be.

In short, the structural damage that unbridled advertising influences can cause touches the core of our well-being: cognitive exhaustion, disturbed rest, and an eroded free will. One could say that our “mental ecosystems” are in danger of becoming as overloaded as a body that is constantly given junk food or a city with permanent noise pollution.

#### **‘Equivalent Resonance Dose’ (ERD): A Metric for Influence**

Given the above analyses, it is useful to introduce a concept to quantitatively approach the impact of advertising exposure, regardless of whether it is digital or analog. We propose to explore the idea of an Equivalent Resonance Dose (ERD) – analogous to, for example, the radiation dose in Sievert for radioactivity, or the noise exposure in decibel-hours.

What does ERD entail? It is a hypothetical measure that translates different advertising stimuli into a single scale of cognitive load or “resonance energy” on the brain. This weighs factors such as:

  * Intensity of the stimulus: How strong or striking is the advertisement?
  * Duration of exposure: How long is one exposed to it?
  * Frequency/repetition: How often does the stimulus occur?
  * Personal relevance (resonance sensitivity): To what extent does the stimulus “touch” something in the person?
  * Environmental factors: Context in which one receives the stimulus (relaxed at home vs. tired late at work vs. shopping with decision fatigue).

With ERD, you could say, for example: an hour on social media with a personalized feed and video ads is equivalent to – say – X milliresonance (mR) of dose, while 30 minutes of walking through a busy city center full of neon signs is equivalent to Y mR. Although it is still speculative, research could find patterns, for example: above 100 mR per day, the risk of cognitive fatigue increases exponentially; above 200 mR per day, we see measurable sleep abnormalities, etc.

Such a concept can help create awareness that all advertising stimuli add up. Now people often think: “Oh well, I can handle those few advertisements.” But just as a single cigarette does not cause lung cancer, the accumulation of thousands of small stimuli per day can still have a big effect. ERD emphasizes the total exposure and could be used as an instrument in policy: comparable to guidelines for maximum noise exposure in the workplace, we could imagine something like “maximum advertising exposure for healthy brain function.”

This idea is still in its infancy – it is a proposal for further research. Making it measurable is complex, because how do you quantify, for example, emotional impact versus purely sensory impact? Perhaps with combinations of biometric data (brain activity, heart rate changes) and behavioral data (click-through rates, buying behavior) a kind of index can be formulated. The key principle in any case is that digital and analog influences are placed on one axis: it is about their end result in our brain, not the carrier per se.

#### **Lessons from the Tobacco Advertising Ban and Possible Regulatory Measures**

In the history of public health and advertising, the ban on tobacco advertising is a milestone. Why was tobacco advertising banned? Because scientific evidence showed unequivocally that smoking is highly addictive and deadly, and advertising encouraged new generations to start a life-threatening habit. In the Netherlands, the Tobacco Act has been in force since 2002, which prohibits almost all forms of tobacco advertising and sponsorship. This was (and is) considered a drastic measure, given the principle of commercial freedom of expression. But public health was weighed more heavily: the importance of preventing people (especially young people) from starting to smoke and not tempting former smokers to relapse.

The tobacco advertising ban teaches us two things relevant to the current discussion:

  * Recognition of Harm: There was a need for broad recognition that tobacco use causes great harm (cancer, heart disease, addiction) and that advertising was a causal factor in this (more advertising = more smokers, especially beginners). Only when that awareness became widespread – thanks in part to reports from the Surgeon General in the US, WHO campaigns, and years of public education – did the political will to restrict advertising emerge. Analogously, we should now clearly demonstrate the harm of unbridled manipulative advertising on mental health and autonomy. Certain terms are already appearing: social media as “the new tobacco,” warning labels, etc., which indicates that this comparison is beginning to land.
  * Extent of Measures: The tobacco advertising ban was almost total: from billboards to TV commercials, from sports event sponsorship to bus stop posters – everything went black for cigarettes. This is because otherwise the advertising budgets would simply move to the weakest uncontrolled channel. And indeed, tobacco manufacturers moved to developing countries with lax rules when it was shut down in Western countries. For modern advertising influences, this means that half measures do little good. If, for example, you only regulated TV commercials, it would move to online microtargeting. A law on the transparency of algorithms without enforcement can be circumvented by trade secrets. A comprehensive approach is needed, preferably internationally coordinated (the internet does not stop at national borders).

What concrete regulatory steps come into view if we extend the analogy? We can think of:

  * Restrictions on targeted (personalized) advertisements, especially for vulnerable groups such as children and teenagers.
  * A ban or strict limits on political microtargeting during elections, to prevent manipulation of democratic processes.
  * Transparency requirements and data minimization: Platforms must provide insight into why you see a certain advertisement.
  * Algorithm auditing: Independent regulators who scrutinize algorithms for extremely manipulative effects.
  * Rate limiting and nudging: Techniques to limit the dose (for example, a maximum number of advertisements per hour).
  * Psychological testing of advertisements: Just as medicines must go through a test, very influential advertising campaigns should go through an ethics committee.

We are already seeing movement: the UK has (albeit with a delay) a law ready to ban junk food advertising on TV and online before 9 p.m. to combat childhood obesity. More and more countries are also banning gambling advertisements or placing heavy disclaimers on them, because of the addiction risks. All of this follows the tobacco model: identify a harmful effect, demonstrate that advertising exacerbates it, and take measures to reduce that influence.

#### **Conclusion**

Digital and analog advertising may seem different at first glance – one takes place on our screens via complex algorithms, the other in the physical world via posters, packaging, and stores – but they work on the same brain pathways. Both use resonance: finding those frequencies (visual, auditory, emotional) on which our brains vibrate along. Whether it is the dopamine kick from an Instagram like, the warm recognition from a background song, or the blinking neon sign that involuntarily catches our eye, our mental state is constantly being subtly modulated.

We have seen that this constant influence is not without consequences. Just as long-term exposure to noise can damage our hearing, long-term exposure to a barrage of advertising stimuli can damage our cognitive ability, sleep rhythm, and sense of autonomy. In that sense, it is appropriate that commentators call social media and aggressive marketing “the new cigarette.” The comparison is not one-to-one, but it does serve as a warning. With tobacco, we as a society ultimately said: this product is so harmful that we no longer allow glorifying advertising for it. With addictive digital services and manipulative advertising expressions, we may be at a similar turning point.

A concept such as Equivalent Resonance Dose (ERD) can help to make the abstract impact more tangible: it forces us to think in terms of the total burden on the brain. Perhaps there will come a time when we keep a daily “mental pedometer” to see if we stay below a healthy advertising dose – just as we now pay attention to calorie intake or dBs. That sounds futuristic, but it underlines the core: too much is too much, even when it comes to information and influence.

Finally, we must emphasize that advertising in itself is not necessarily malicious – it can also be informative and entertaining. The problem lies in the imbalance and invisibility of the current influence. When every free minute and every empty corner of our gaze is filled with a commercially or politically tinted stimulus, there is little room left for the own, autonomous thoughts and rest that we need for a healthy brain.

The challenge for the future is to find a middle way: preserving free information traffic and creativity, but curbing harmful excesses. Just as we as a community have decided that clean drinking water, clean air, and smoke-free public spaces are a basic right, we could decide that a “mental environment” free from constant manipulation is a worthwhile goal. This requires courageous policy choices, inspired by precedents such as the tobacco advertising ban, and perhaps entirely new approaches appropriate to the digital age.

Meanwhile, science continues to sharpen the picture: every study on dopamine addiction, subliminal cues, sleep, and cognition adds evidence that we must take this topic seriously. Hopefully, that resonating message will ultimately lead to awareness among both the public (“I am aware of the influences around me”) and policymakers (“we must set limits to protect”). Because resonance can go both ways: not only can external parties bring us into resonance, we as a collective can also resonate back with a counter-voice – namely that our mind should not be a plaything of unbridled advertising influences. That is the core of the parallel with tobacco advertising: ultimately, it is about protecting the person themselves, our brain, and our choices, against undermining addiction and manipulation. As soon as that parallel really resonates, regulation will be the logical next step.

### **Technical Annex: Equivalent Resonance Dose (ERD)**

This section introduces the concept of the **Equivalent Resonance Dose (ERD)**, a **hypothetical, theoretical model** that quantifies the cumulative impact of advertising on an individual. The model is purely conceptual and serves as a formal framework to compare the influence of digital and analog advertising on a single scale. The formulas have been copied exactly and unchanged to maintain the integrity of the original framework.

#### **0. Notation (compact)**

  * $t$: time (s); $f$: frequency (Hz); $\\omega=2\\pi f$ (rad/s)
  * Vectors are bold: $\\mathbf{s}(t)$, $\\mathbf{x}(t)$. Fourier: $\\mathcal{F}{\\cdot}(f)$.
  * $\\langle\\cdot\\rangle\_T$: time average over window $T$.
  * $|\\cdot|\_2$: quadratic norm; $|\\cdot|$: modulus; $\\odot$: element-wise product.

#### **1. Stimulus Modeling (digital and analog, multimodal)**

The advertising stimulus is modeled as a composite time series:

$$
\mathbf{s}(t)=
\begin{bmatrix}
s_{\text{vis}}(t)
s_{\text{aud}}(t)
s_{\text{txt}}(t)
s_{\text{soc}}(t)
\end{bmatrix}
$$

* $s_{\text{vis}}(t)$: visual stimulus (e.g., brightness, contrast, motion)
* $s_{\text{aud}}(t)$: auditory stimulus (sound, music)
* $s_{\text{txt}}(t)$: textual/semantic stimulus (keywords)
* $s_{\text{soc}}(t)$: social stimulus (likes, shares, notifications)

Each stimulus has a "salience" or conspicuousness, $m_k(t)$, defined as the rate of change of the stimulus:
$$m_k(t) = \left|\frac{d}{dt} s_k(t)\right|^\alpha, \quad \alpha \in [0.5, 1]$$
This salience captures the degree of abrupt change that attracts attention, such as a quick scene change in a video or a sudden loud beat in music.

#### **2. Resonance Filter**

The brain is modeled as a set of resonance frequencies (e.g., the naturally occurring oscillations). The extent to which an external stimulus resonates with the brain is described by a filter, $H_k(f)$.
$$H_k(f) = \frac{1}{1 + \left(\frac{f - f_{0,k}}{\Delta f_k}\right)^{2p}}$$Here $f_{0,k}$ is the resonance frequency of the k-th mode in the brain, and $\Delta f_k$ is the bandwidth of the resonance. The "sensitivity" of the brain to a certain frequency, $\chi_k(f)$, is the weighting of this filter:$$\chi_k(f) = w_k \cdot H_k^2(f) \cdot \sigma_k(f)$$
Here, $w_k$ is a weighting factor and $\sigma_k(f)$ is the power spectral density of the internal, endogenous "background noise" of the brain. This noise can change due to factors such as sleep deprivation or stress, which affects resonance sensitivity.

#### **3. The Equivalent Resonance Dose (ERD)**

The Equivalent Resonance Dose ($\text{ERD}$) is the central metric and is modeled as a cumulative dose. The dose rate, $\dot{D}(t)$, is a combination of the physical "resonance power" and a salience factor:
$$\dot{D}(t) = \underbrace{\gamma \left\langle \sum_k \int_0^\infty \chi_k(f) \left|\mathcal{F}\{s_k(t)\}\right|^2 df \right\rangle_T}_{\text{Physical Resonance Power, } P_{\text{res}}(t)} \cdot \underbrace{\Big(1+\lambda\,\bar{m}(t)\Big)}_{\text{Salience}}$$
The resonance power, $P_{\text{res}}(t)$, is the sum of the spectral energy of each stimulus, weighted by the sensitivity of the brain, $\chi_k(f)$. The dose rate, $\dot{D}(t)$, is therefore higher as the stimulus is stronger and resonates better with the brain. The salience factor, $1+\lambda\,\bar{m}(t)$, increases the dose for stimuli that attract attention. 

The cumulative ERD over a period, $\text{ERD}(T_1, T_2)$, is simply the integral of the dose rate:
$$\mathrm{ERD}(T_1,T_2)=\int_{T_1}^{T_2}\dot{D}(t)\,dt$$
This provides a single, unified measure of total exposure, allowing direct comparison between different media types (e.g., a digital ad versus a billboard). The "Equivalent" in ERD suggests that one can convert different stimuli to the same scale. This allows a direct comparison, such as the hypothesis: $ERD_{digital} = ERD_{analog}$ would lead to a similar biological response.

The model also takes into account the synergistic effect of multi-sensory stimuli. When different channels are coherent (e.g., synchronized sound and image), their impact is amplified, which can be captured in a correlation term.
$$\mathrm{ERD} \leftarrow \mathrm{ERD} + \kappa \sum_{k \ne \ell} \int_0^\infty \rho_{k\ell}(f) \, |\mathcal{F}\{s_k(t)\}| \, |\mathcal{F}\{s_\ell(t)\}| \, df$$
Here, $\rho_{k\ell}(f)$ is a frequency-dependent correlation factor between stimulus $k$ and stimulus $\ell$.

#### **4. Relationship between ERD and Observable Biomarkers**

The framework posits that ERD should correlate with measurable **biomarkers** of cognitive and physiological stress, such as EEG coherence, heart rate variability (HRV), and pupil dilation. The relationship between the dose, $\text{ERD}$, and a biomarker, $\Delta B_j$, can be linear in the simplest form. However, to model saturation effects, the more advanced **Hill equation** can be used:
$$\Delta B_j = \frac{E_{\max,j}\,\mathrm{ERD}^{\,h_j}}{K_{j}^{\,h_j}+\mathrm{ERD}^{\,h_j}}$$
This equation describes the non-linear relationship where an increasing dose (ERD) has an increasing effect up to a maximum response, $E_{\max,j}$. The parameter $K_j$ represents the dose at which the effect is half-maximal, a useful indicator for a **threshold value**.

#### **5. Implications for Policy and Research**

This formal framework provides a basis for a comparative analysis of the impact of advertising. It sets a hypothesis that can be tested: if digital and analog advertising have the same ERD, the model predicts that the measured biomarker response ($\Delta B_j$) will also be comparable, which would demonstrate mechanistic equality. The ERD metric could also lead to the establishment of **normative threshold values** for advertising exposure. This would be comparable to the way limits are set for noise levels in the workplace or for radiation levels, and can provide a basis for future policy to protect mental public health.

### **Annex: Research Agenda (DRE-RAAM)**

This is a research proposal that has been formulated for another AI system to conduct in-depth studies. The goal is to demonstrate with repeatable experiments that digital and analog stimuli activate the same neurophysiological resonance mechanisms.

#### **1. Core Hypotheses (H) per Pillar**
* **H1 — Digital algorithms:** Personalized patterns cause coherence disruption in brain activity and HRV dysregulation.
* **H2 — Music damage:** Specific spectral patterns lead to dose-response changes in EEG coherence and sleep quality.
* **H3 — Advertising damage from algorithms:** Micro-targeting manipulates attention resonance and urge to buy.
* **H4 — Analog (billboards, retail):** Identical resonance signatures are found as with digital stimuli.
* **H5 — Bridge Digital↔Analog:** One metric, the **Equivalent Resonance Dose (ERD)**, can put all conditions on a single scale.

#### **2. Measurement Framework (Biomarkers & Behavior)**
The following biomarkers and behavioral measurements must be used:
* **Neurophysiological:** EEG coherence, HRV, skin conduction, pupillometry.
* **Endocrine/Sleep:** Salivary cortisol, melatonin, actigraphy.
* **Cognition/Affect:** PVT, N-back, impulsivity scores.

#### **3. Pillar Studies**
The proposal describes four in-depth studies and one bridge study to test the hypotheses. These include audits of digital algorithms, experiments with music, micro-targeting research, and simulations of analog environments such as billboards and stores.

### **Legal and Policy Implications**

A judge may order further expert investigation based on this report under the precautionary principle. Formulate in legal language: “If preliminary evidence shows substantial risk, the Court may order independent investigation (deskundigenonderzoek) to quantify ERD-related health harms.”

The analogy with the tobacco advertising ban teaches that if the burden of proof accumulates and a clear link with harm is recognized, this can lead to intervention.
