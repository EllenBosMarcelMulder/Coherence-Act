Dear Sir/Madam,

Please find attached the complete dossier of the *Coherence-Act*, submitted for consideration under the UNESCO 2003 Convention for the Safeguarding of Intangible Cultural Heritage.

This submission consists of the following documents:

1. **UNESCO-Application-Letter.pdf** (cover letter)  
2. **Coherence-Act.pdf** (framework / Act text)  
3. **LICENSE.pdf** (Humanity Heritage License v1.0)  
4. **Implosive-Field-Theory-and-Plasma-Dynamics.pdf** (scientific annex)

### Purpose of submission
The *Coherence-Act* is a universal framework uniting science, culture, and ethics, based on the recognition of coherence in biology, society, and physics as a fundamental principle of human dignity and peace. Its custodians (Marcel Mulder, Ellen Bos, Niels Groeneveld) submit this framework as intangible heritage of humanity, with safeguarding measures against misuse and with free access for education and humanitarian purposes.

The scientific annex (“Implosive Field Theory and Plasma Dynamics: A Unified Framework for Multi-Scale Coherent Phenomena”) provides the technical basis of the framework, including mathematical models, experimental validation protocols, and an ethical governance plan addressing dual-use concerns.
