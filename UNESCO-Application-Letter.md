Subject: Application for Recognition of the *Coherence-Act* as Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity  

---

Dear Sir/Madam,  

With great respect, I hereby submit the enclosed documentation of the *Coherence-Act* for consideration as an element of Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity, under the UNESCO 2003 Convention for the Safeguarding of Intangible Cultural Heritage.  

The *Coherence-Act* is a universal framework uniting science, culture, and ethics. It is founded on the recognition of coherence — in biology, physics, society, and culture — as a fundamental principle of human dignity, health, and peace. Its custodians, including Marcel Mulder, Ellen Bos, and Niels Groeneveld, have developed this framework to protect humanity against systemic desynchronization, digital harm, and misuse of resonance fields.  

This application is submitted on the basis of the following:  

1. **Definition as intangible heritage**  
   The *Coherence-Act* represents a body of knowledge, practice, and cultural transmission that addresses the safeguarding of life, knowledge, and dignity across generations. It is shared openly as knowledge for humanity and is preserved in both written and digital form.  

2. **Urgency and need for safeguarding**  
   Contemporary societies face digital and systemic threats that disrupt biological and cultural coherence. This framework establishes protective principles to preserve human rights, DNA integrity, and cultural survival.  

3. **Safeguarding measures**  
   The *Coherence-Act* includes a dedicated license (Humanity Heritage License v1.0) to ensure:  
   - Free access for education and humanitarian use.  
   - Explicit prohibition of military and exploitative applications.  
   - Protection of custodians and recognition of authorship.  
   These measures guarantee both cultural continuity and responsible transmission.  

4. **Community participation**  
   The framework has been developed and safeguarded by its custodians (Mulder, Bos, Groeneveld) and is transmitted through open-source repositories, foundations, and global outreach. It is intended for all humanity as a shared heritage, with responsibility for preservation by states, universities, and citizens alike.  

5. **International significance**  
   The *Coherence-Act* builds a bridge between scientific knowledge and cultural heritage. It reflects a new paradigm of safeguarding that is urgently needed in the 21st century.  

Enclosed with this letter are:  
- **Coherence-Act.md** — the full text of the Act.  
- **LICENSE.md** — the Humanity Heritage License v1.0, regulating its preservation and use.  

We respectfully request the Ministry to consider this application, and to forward it to UNESCO via the Permanent Delegation of the Kingdom of the Netherlands in Paris, for evaluation under the Convention.  

With highest respect,  

Marcel Mulder  
On behalf of the custodians of the Coherence-Act  
The Netherlands
