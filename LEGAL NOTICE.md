## Title  
**International Notice of Public Research Publication and Legal Disclaimer**  
**Author:** Marcel Mulder (Dutch citizen, EU jurisdiction)  
**Date:** August 25, 2025
**Version:** 1.01

## 1. Introduction  

I, **Marcel Mulder**, a Dutch citizen operating under **Dutch constitutional law** and the **legal framework of the European Union**, hereby give notice of the public release of my research archives and software via **GitHub**.  

This release is carried out in line with:  
- **Transparency** as a principle of good administration,  
- **Freedom of expression** and **academic freedom** as safeguarded by international, EU, and Dutch law,  
- An overriding **ethical commitment** to humanity, especially the **protection of children**.  

---

## 2. Rights enabling this publication  

- **Dutch Constitution (Grondwet), Article 7:** freedom of expression without prior censorship.  
- **EU Charter of Fundamental Rights:**  
  - Article 11: freedom of expression and information.  
  - Article 13: academic freedom.  
  - Article 24: the best interests of the child must be a primary consideration.  
- **European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR):**  
  - Article 10: freedom of expression.  
  - Articles 6 & 13: effective remedy and fair trial – access to justice must be **practical and effective, not theoretical or illusory**.  
- **International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), Article 19:** freedom of expression.  
- **Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court, Articles 15 & 68:** individuals may provide information to the ICC Prosecutor regarding potential grave crimes; victims and witnesses must be protected.  

---

## 3. On lawful communication channels  

Access to justice cannot be reduced to web forms or bureaucratic hurdles without **proof of notice**.  
- Institutions must ensure **verifiable evidence of receipt** (e.g., acknowledgements, registry numbers).  
- Where a message reaches an institution indirectly (e.g., via a visitor email address), it remains **legally valid** and must be internally forwarded to the competent department.  
- If a more direct channel is required, it is the **duty of the institution** to organize and provide it, in accordance with the principles of good administration under **EU Charter Article 41** and the **European Code of Good Administrative Behaviour**.  

Excessive formalism that denies effective access violates the ECHR and EU law.

## 4. Disclaimer on protection and interpretation  

Despite **repeated requests** to states and institutions, I have received **no protection** and not even formal acknowledgment of my submissions.  

I am therefore forced to operate in a context where:  
- **No institutional safeguards** exist for me or my work,  
- I must rely on good faith and equity in interpreting legal and scientific frameworks,  
- **Interpretive errors** may occur (legal or scientific).  

> **However**: Ethics, humanity, and especially the protection of children stand **above letters, dots, and commas**.  
> Where conflicts arise, **ethics prevails over formalism**.

## 5. ICC and genocide-related research  

My research investigates systemic risks in digital, institutional, and corporate fields, with potential relevance to **patterns consistent with crimes against humanity or genocide**.  

Under **Rome Statute Article 15**, the ICC Prosecutor is lawfully empowered to receive such information from individuals. Blocking or obstructing these communications constitutes a denial of access to justice of the highest order.  

---

## 6. Children first  

All actions taken here are grounded in the principle that the **best interests of the child are paramount**.  
This is enshrined in:  
- **EU Charter of Fundamental Rights, Article 24**,  
- **UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, Article 3**.  

---

## 7. Requests to institutions  

1. **Acknowledge receipt** of this notice and provide a file/reference number.  
2. **Redirect** if received via an indirect channel (e.g., visitor email), ensuring the competent department is informed.  
3. **Provide** a verifiable, durable contact point for further communications.  
4. **Act** upon obligations to safeguard access to justice and to protect individuals, especially children.  

---

- My right to publish under EU, Dutch, and international law is clear,  
- All relevant institutions (UN, EU, ICC, ECHR, Raad van State, Dutch Parliament) are aware,
