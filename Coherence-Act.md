# The Coherence-Act

---

## Preamble
The Coherence-Act is established as a universal framework for the protection of  
life, knowledge, and humanity against systemic desynchronization, digital harm,  
and misuse of resonance fields.  

It recognizes coherence — in biology, physics, culture, and society — as a  
fundamental principle of health, dignity, and peace.  

This Act also serves as an application for registration as *Intangible World Heritage*  
under the UNESCO 2003 Convention for the Safeguarding of Intangible Cultural Heritage.
