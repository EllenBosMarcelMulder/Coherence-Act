# The Coherence-Act

---

## Preamble
The Coherence-Act is established as a universal framework for the protection of  
life, knowledge, and humanity against systemic desynchronization, digital harm,  
and misuse of resonance fields.  

It recognizes coherence — in biology, physics, culture, and society — as a  
fundamental principle of health, dignity, and peace.  

This Act also serves as an application for registration as *Intangible World Heritage*  
under the UNESCO 2003 Convention for the Safeguarding of Intangible Cultural Heritage.

## Article 1 — Purpose
- To safeguard the universal right to coherent life and environment.  
- To ensure open access to knowledge for education and humanitarian purposes.  
- To protect present and future generations against desynchronization, DNA damage,  
  and systemic harm from uncontrolled fields and digital infrastructures.  

---

## Article 2 — Scope
- Covers all scientific, cultural, and technological materials connected to  
  the Coherence-Act framework, including RC1/hexOSnoOS.  
- Applies globally, across education, biology, culture, and digital society.  
- Integrates scientific protection with cultural preservation.  

---

## Article 3 — Rights
- **Educational Right**: Free access for learning, teaching, and research.  
- **Human Dignity**: Recognition of coherence as vital to human health.  
- **Inventors’ Recognition**: Founders (Marcel Mulder, Ellen Bos, Niels Groeneveld)  
  are acknowledged as custodians, witnesses, and transmitters of this heritage.  

---

## Article 4 — Prohibitions
- No commercial exploitation without explicit consent of the custodians.  
- No military or surveillance use.  
- No suppression, distortion, or misuse of the scientific/cultural record.  

---

## Article 5 — Duties
- **States**: To implement protective measures and safeguard citizens’ coherence.  
- **Universities & Institutions**: To preserve and transmit the knowledge.  
- **UNESCO**: To recognize and safeguard this as humanity’s intangible heritage.  

---

## Article 6 — Enforcement
- Violations may result in liability under human rights law and international law.  
- Custodians reserve the right to escalate to ICC/ECHR in cases of state negligence.  
- Global oversight bodies must ensure compliance.

## Heritage Declaration
The Coherence-Act is hereby declared as *Intangible World Heritage of Knowledge*.  
It is to be preserved, transmitted, and protected in service of humanity.  

This document serves both as a **legal-ethical framework** and as an **application  
for recognition by UNESCO** under the 2003 Convention.
