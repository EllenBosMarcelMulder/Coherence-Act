# The Coherence-Act

## Preamble
The Coherence-Act is established as a universal framework to protect life,  
knowledge, and humanity against systemic desynchronization, digital damage,  
and misuse of resonance fields.  

It recognizes coherence — in biology, society, and physics — as a fundamental  
principle of health, dignity, and peace.
